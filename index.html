            <h2>1. About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Charlie Doubet — a senior at The University of Iowa, majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems with a minor in Communication Studies. I’m originally from Denver, Colorado, where I’ve lived my whole life. One question I always get is, “Why did you choose Iowa over Colorado?” The short answer: my dad went here, so I grew up a proud Hawkeye. Choosing Iowa has been one of the best decisions I’ve made, giving me not only a strong education but also lifelong friendships and unforgettable experiences.

                One of the highlights of my college journey was studying abroad in Barcelona last spring. It was truly a life-changing experience, and something I’d recommend to everyone.</p>

            <h2>2. Favorite Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Movies are my ultimate escape from reality. I've watched so many films that I'm pretty sure I could survive solely on movie trivia and popcorn. My top five movies are a wild ride through different genres, proving that my taste is as unpredictable as a plot twist in a M. Night Shyamalan film.</p>

            <p>Sports are more than just games - they're a complex emotional rollercoaster that I willingly subject myself to every season. My loyalty to these teams is stronger than my commitment to most personal relationships.</p>
